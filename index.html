        It ain't no joke, I'd like to buy the world a toke, And teach the world to sing in perfect harmony, And teach the world to snuff the fires and the liars, Hey, I know it's just a song, but it's spice for the recipe, This is a love attack, I know it went out, but it's back, It's just like any fad, it retracts before impact, And just like fashion it's a passion for the with-it and hip, If you got the goods, they'll come and buy it, Just to stay in the clique, So don't delay, act now, supplies are running out, Allow if you're still alive, six to eight years to arrive, And if you follow there may be a tomorrow, But if the offer's shunned, You might as well be walking on the Sun, Twenty-five years ago, they spoke out and they broke out, Of recession and oppression and together they toked, And they folked out with guitars around a bonfire, Just singin' and clappin', man, what the hell happened?, Then some were spellbound, some were hellbound, Some, they fell down and some got back up, And fought back against the meltdown, And their kids were hippie chicks, all hypocrites, Because fashion is smashing the true meaning of it, So don't delay, act now, supplies are running out, Allow if you're still alive, six to eight years to arrive, And if you follow, there may be a tomorrow, But if the offer's shunned, You might as well be walking on the sun, It ain't no joke when a mama's handkerchief is soaked, With her tears because her baby's life has been revoked, The bond is broke up, so choke up and focus on the close up, Mr. Wizard can't perform no god-like hocus-pocus, So don't sit back, kick back and watch the world get bushwhacked, News at ten, your neighborhood is under attack, Put away the crack before the crack puts you away, You need to be there when your baby's old enough to relate, So don't delay, act now, supplies are running out, Allow if you're still alive, six to eight years to arrive, And if you follow, there may be a tomorrow, But if the offer's shunned, You might as well be walking on the sun, You might as well be walking on the sun, You might as well be walking on the sun, You might as well be walking on the sun, You might as well be walking on the sun

    <h2>On planet Earth it's a place to live your life. Where pleasure follows pain, People go insane, Fly around in planes, Pray that it won't rain, Drive around in cars, Get drunk in local bars, Dream of being stars, Well I lived all my life on planet Earth</h2>
